Tourism is a lucrative industry, and you, being a modern-day business tycoon with a brand-new city, 
are racing to get a piece of the action, but youâ€™re not the only slimy mogul around here! The nearest 
airport is a hotspot for roping in droves of tourists to come to your city, but there are no roads 
connecting the airport to your tourist trap. It is within your (unethically powerful) hands to construct 
a roadway that herds people into your town, while also keeping the tourists away from your competitor's city! 
Roads to Riches is designed for 2 players of all ages.
